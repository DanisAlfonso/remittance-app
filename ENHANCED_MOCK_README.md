# Enhanced Mock + Real API Implementation

## 🎯 What This Solves

The **Enhanced Mock + Real API** approach gives you:
- ✅ **Working multi-user functionality** (your core value proposition)
- ✅ **Real API learning** (when you have credentials)
- ✅ **No blocking errors** (always works regardless of credentials)
- ✅ **Seamless development experience**

## 🔧 How It Works

### **Multi-User Features (Always Mock)**
- **Account Creation**: Each user gets a unique, deterministic IBAN
- **User Isolation**: Perfect isolation between different users
- **Multi-User Transfers**: Users can send money to each other
- **Balance Management**: Individual balances per user

### **Learning Features (Real API When Available)**
- **Exchange Rates**: Uses real Wise rates when possible
- **Quote Generation**: Real quote structure and responses
- **API Error Handling**: Learn real Wise API behavior

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### **Option 1: Basic Setup (Immediate)**
Just run the app - it works out of the box with enhanced mocks!

```bash
npm run dev
```

### **Option 2: Enhanced Learning (Optional)**
Get a personal token for real API learning:

1. **Create Sandbox Account**: https://sandbox.transferwise.tech/
2. **Get Personal Token**: Settings → API tokens (requires 2FA)
3. **Add to Environment**:
   ```bash
   # In your .env file
   WISE_PERSONAL_TOKEN=your-personal-sandbox-token
   ```

## 🏗️ Architecture Benefits

### **Why Mock for Multi-User?**
- Personal tokens can only access YOUR account
- Partner API requires business partnership
- Mocks provide the **realistic multi-user experience** you need

### **Why Real API for Learning?**
- Understand actual Wise response structures
- Learn real error handling patterns
- See authentic exchange rates and fees

## 📱 User Experience

### **Account Creation**
```
✅ User A creates account → Gets IBAN: DE891234567890123456
✅ User B creates account → Gets IBAN: DE891234567890654321
✅ Each user has isolated balance and transactions
```

### **Transfers Between Users**
```
✅ User A sends €100 to User B's IBAN
✅ User A balance decreases by €100 + fees
✅ User B balance increases by €100
✅ Both see transaction history
```

### **Real API Integration**
```
📊 Exchange rates: Real data from Wise (when token available)
🎭 Account creation: Enhanced mock (more realistic than personal token)
💰 Transfers: Mock simulation (perfect for multi-user testing)
```

## 🎓 Learning Benefits

### **What You Learn With Personal Token**
- Real Wise API response structures
- Actual error handling patterns
- Live exchange rates and fees
- Rate limiting behavior

### **What Mocks Provide**
- Multi-user account management
- User-to-user transfers
- Individual balance tracking
- Realistic IBAN generation

## 🔄 Upgrade Path

When you're ready for partnership:
1. **Apply to Wise Platform** with your working demo
2. **Get Partner credentials** (Client ID/Secret)
3. **Minimal code changes** needed (architecture already supports it)
4. **Seamless transition** to production

## 🏃‍♂️ Current Status

- ✅ **Enhanced mock implementation** active
