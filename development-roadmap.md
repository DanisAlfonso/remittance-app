## Development Notes

### Important Decisions Made
**MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL UPGRADE - EXPO ROUTER MIGRATION**
- **Decision**: Migrated from React Navigation to Expo Router for production-grade file-based routing
- **Reason**: Production fintech applications require the most robust and maintainable architecture
- **Impact**:

  - Production-grade folder organization (lib/, types/, utils/, components/)
  - Enhanced security with input sanitization and validation
  - TypeScript strict typing throughout application
  - ErrorBoundary for production error handling
  - Improved developer experience and maintainability

**FRONTEND ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS**
- **Structure**: Organized into logical modules (lib/, types/, utils/, components/)
- **Routing**: File-based routing with authentication guards
- **State Management**: Zustand with secure persistence
- **Security**: Input validation, sanitization, XSS prevention
- **UI Components**: Reusable, typed components with consistent styling

### API Integration Status
